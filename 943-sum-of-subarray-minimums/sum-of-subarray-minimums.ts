/*
For each number in given array, we will count the number of subarrays in which the number
appears as the minimum. Then, we will multiply it with the number's value and add it to a sum.

The number of subarrays in which the number appears as the minimum = 
distance between current element and element less than current element on the left (Previous Less Element)
*
distance between current element and element less than current element on the right (Next Less Element)

We will fill two arrays PLE[] and NLE[], where PLE[i] is the index of previous less element of arr[i] and NLE[i] is the index of next less element of arr[i] using Stack. Then, we will
iterate through given array and at each index we will add (i-PLE[i]) * (NLE[i]-i) * arr[i] to a global sum. If there isn't PLE for arr[i], PLE[i] will be -1, and if there isn't NLE for arr[i] NLE[i] will be arr.length.
